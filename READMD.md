#Discover Bible
A collective effort by four summer interns at Microsoft (2015) to create an intelligent passage-suggesting bible.

### Ideas for Future Functionality

* Search bar on homepage, rather than simple chapter selection.

* Topic displayed on the bottom of the page.

* Generate a plan based on chapter and/or topic.

* Save a plan.

* Improve topics/suggestions:
  * Cluster bible passages/chapters rather than suggest most similar.
  * Get data to parse passages rather than chapters.
  * LDA instead of NMF.
